# NoWayBackBrowser
The "No Way Back Browser" is a simple web browser built using PyQt5 and QtWebEngineWidgets. Unlike traditional web browsers, this browser deliberately disables the ability to go back or forward in the browsing history and removes the right-click context menu. It offers a unique browsing experience where users can only navigate forward and can't go back, hence the name "No Way Back." This project aims to explore alternative browsing behaviors and challenge the conventional browsing paradigm.
